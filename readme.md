## Why this project exists

Disk space is finite, but the way a drive is laid out can make a big difference in performance and usability. Many users run into a mismatch between their needs and what their disk can deliver. This project provides a focused set of tools to address common disk partition tasks without the complexity of larger suites. It is designed to be straightforward, reliable, and easy to audit.

The goal is not to surprise you with abstract features. It is to give you practical control over partitions, with clear steps, sensible defaults, and a consistent experience across tasks. If you have a drive with unallocated space, you can extend a system partition. If you need to reclaim space from a growing data partition, you can shrink and reorganize. If you want to prepare a drive for a new OS, you can migrate the system while keeping your data safe.

## How it works

- The tools operate by presenting a straightforward view of disk partitions, including size, start and end sectors, and file system types.
- Users pick a task (resize, merge, split, convert, migrate) and specify the source and target partitions or drives.
- The tool performs a series of checks to minimize risk:
  - Verifies there is contiguous unallocated space when resizing or extending.
  - Ensures the operation does not affect system-critical partitions unless explicitly requested.
  - Checks file system integrity if required steps are involved.
- For most tasks, changes are previewed before applying. You review the proposed results and confirm to proceed.
- After the operation, the tool validates the outcome and reports results. If any issues occur, it offers guidance on next steps.

## System requirements

- Windows 10 or later (64-bit) for most operations.
- Administrative privileges to apply changes to drives and partitions.
- A drive with sufficient free space for operations that require staging (e.g., resizing may need temporary space for safe operation).
- A reliable backup is strongly recommended before performing any partition changes.

Notes:
- Some operations may require a reboot or a restart into a recovery environment to complete.
- If you are using a dual-boot setup, exercise caution when modifying the boot partition and related system partitions.

## Getting started

This section walks you through a typical workflow: preparing, installing, and performing a common task like resizing a partition.

- Installation
  - From the Releases page, download the installer that matches your Windows version.
  - Run the installer and follow the on-screen steps to set up the tools.
  - If the installer asks about permissions, grant them to allow full disk access during maintenance tasks.

- First steps
  - Launch the tools and grant any required permissions for disk access.
  - The main window presents a list of disks and partitions with their sizes and file systems.
  - If you are unsure about a task, use the preview feature to see what would happen without applying changes.

- A simple resize example
  - Select a partition that has free space adjacent to it.
  - Choose resize, and in the dialog specify the new size or drag the boundary.
  - Confirm the preview and apply if you are satisfied with the plan.
  - The system performs the operation and reports success or details if something needs attention.

- A simple merge example
  - Choose two adjacent partitions and select merge.
  - Confirm that the operation will create a single contiguous partition.
  - Apply once you are confident in the outcome.

- A simple split example
  - Pick a partition that has enough data to split into two volumes.
  - Define the size for the new partition and apply.
  - The tool will reorganize data and create the new partition.

- A simple convert or migration example
  - If you need to switch partition style (MBR to GPT or GPT to MBR), choose convert.
  - To migrate an OS to another disk, select the source OS partition and target disk, then start the migration workflow.
  - Always confirm boot configurations after migration to ensure the system starts as expected.

## Working with partitions: practical guidance

Resize partitions
- Determine the amount of free space you can safely reclaim.
- Use the preview to ensure the new boundary aligns with unallocated space and does not encroach on data.
- If the partition contains important data, consider moving data to free space first.

Merge partitions
- Adjacent partitions are required for a merge.
- Back up before merging in case you need to revert.
- After merging, verify that the resulting partition is accessible and that data remains intact.

Split partitions
- Decide how to divide the space while preserving data distribution.
- Plan a naming convention or folder structure to keep data organized after the split.
- Check that both resulting partitions are properly labeled with file systems and drive letters as needed.

Convert disk formats
- Converting between MBR and GPT is common when adding disks or enabling new features.
- Ensure the target environment supports the chosen partition style.
- Be aware that certain partitioned configurations may require adjustments to bootloaders or system settings.

Migration tasks
- OS migration to a new drive can improve performance or allow upgrading to a larger drive.
- Ensure the destination drive is healthy and has enough capacity for the OS and installed apps.
- After migration, test boot and sign-in to confirm everything works as expected.

Common workflow examples
- Free up space on a data volume, then extend the system partition to maximize available OS resources.
- Reorganize a drive with multiple data partitions by merging small partitions into a larger data partition for simpler management.
- Create a test environment by duplicating a partition to another drive and then performing separate experiments on the copy.

Best practices during operations
- Always back up critical data before performing partition operations.
- Run operations in a controlled environment when possible (e.g., on a test machine or with a test drive).
- Use the preview feature to minimize surprises.
- Do not interrupt an operation in progress, as this can lead to data loss or corruption.

---

## Safety and best practices

- Back up your data before starting any partition operation.
- Ensure you have a reliable power source during long operations.
- Check drive health and perform a SMART test if you suspect issues.
- Avoid performing partition changes on the drive where the OS is installed unless you are certain you know what you are doing.
- If you are unsure, seek guidance from more experienced users or the support channels listed in this repository.

## Troubleshooting

- The tool cannot access a partition
  - Verify that you have administrative privileges.
  - Check whether another program is using the partition. Close other apps and retry.
  - If the problem persists, reboot and try again.

- A resize operation fails to complete
  - Review the preview for any warnings about insufficient or misaligned space.
  - Ensure there is contiguous unallocated space next to the partition you want to resize.
  - Consider shrinking adjacent partitions first to create the necessary space.

- A merge operation fails
  - Confirm that the partitions are adjacent and that there is no hidden or system-critical partition between them.
  - Verify that the target space is available and not in use by another process.
  - If data integrity is a concern, back up before attempting the merge again.

- A migration operation does not boot
  - Confirm the boot configuration on the new drive after migration.
  - Use a repair or fix boot option if needed to restore bootability.
  - Double-check that the OS and its installed applications are functional on the new drive.
